Hello World.

My name is Chelsea Worrel, I am mom to a sweet little girl that is in second grade, she speaks fluent French and makes my world AMAZING.  I love to read, work on house projects and study architecture in my free-time.  - and I would love for you to take the time to view some of my personal projects:

https://stormy-dawn-9838.herokuapp.com
 -- this is a site for educational purposes only that uses the Instagram API and is a place to hold inspiration for Mommas.  Save photos to your profile of all things you love including kids decor and kids style.

https://mighty-cove-2989.herokuapp.com
-- this site is a site for educational purposes only that uses the Instagram API and is basically supposed to look like a fake-Instagram.  I used this site to help learn design elements and Chrome developer tools, as well as become more familiar with OAuth.

http://the-eatsy-project.herokuapp.com/
--this site was a lesson in working with an old code base for a restaurant and turn it into a multi-platform site.  It was a great experience working with legacy code, and building off of and modifying the design of others to create something new and fresh.  Inspiration obviously came from Etsy :) GO ahead and login: username: cdub@gmail and password: password
